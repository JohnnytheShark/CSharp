# C#
## This repository hosts various different C# snippets that I have developed or come up with. 

### Controllers
1. When I first started out this is how I had built an API Controller. [Controller](https://github.com/JohnnytheShark/CSharp/blob/main/ControllerExample.cs)
2. I've since taken courses and learned a lot. Async Example of Controller can be seen here.  [Async Controller](#)

### Practice Problems
1. Count the Data Type problem. Given two arguments, an object and a data type search return the true if the object is of the data type or false if its not. [CountDataType](https://github.com/JohnnytheShark/CSharp/blob/main/CountDataTypes.cs)
